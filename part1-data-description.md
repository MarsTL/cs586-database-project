Project Overview
 
Part 1: Data Description:
a) Select a real-world subject area on which you wish to build a database. Write approximately one paragraph and give a
general description/background information on that subject area. 

The area I chose, based on the database I found, is the relationship between academic performance and career success. 
The database contains 5,000 records with attributes such as gender, age, GPA, starting salary, and internship experience. 
This database seems very complete and has great potential for analysis. Some possible projects include predicting job 
success based on education, identifying key factors influencing salaries, and understanding the role of networking and 
internships in career growth.

b) List 20 questions (in English) that someone might want to ask about the domain. You will later translate these 
questionsto SQL queries in part 3 of this project. Your questions need to be diverse. Think about designing your questions 
in a way that you can use a variety of topics that we covered in class. The questions shouldnâ€™t be intended to use only 
basic SQL queries. 
Note: You are allowed to revise these questions later if needed (with mentioned reasons for the modification.)
Create a query that shows only professors who teach in the Computer Science department.
1. Retrieve all student information.
2. Find students with a high school GPA above 3.5.
3. Create a query to show students who scored above 1200 on the SAT, displaying age, gender, and field of study.
4. Create a query that shows fields of study in descending order by average GPA of students.
5. List students who attended universities ranked in the top 100.
6. Find students majoring in Computer Science.
7. Retrieve students who have completed at least 2 internships.
8. Find the best student by GPA in each department.
9. Give me the average salary of each department.
10. Create a query that shows career satisfaction by field of study.
11. Create a query with the 10 students who have completed the most projects.
12. Give the average age by each field of study.
13. Give me the average gender by field of study and show the average salary by gender.
14. Create a query by field of study with the current job level.
15. Get students with a soft skills score greater than 8.
16. Find students with a networking score of at least 7.
17. Get students with a starting salary above $50,000.
18. Find students who rated their career satisfaction as 5.
19. List students promoted within 3 years, showing age, gender, and field of study.
20. Find students currently in a senior-level job.
21. Get students with a work-life balance score of 8 or higher.
22. Find students who are entrepreneurs, showing gender, age, and field of study.
23. Retrieve students who meet both GPA > 3.8 and SAT > 1300.
24. Find students with internships, certifications, and projects all above 5.
25. Get students majoring in STEM fields with a job offer count above 4.

c) Describe what sources you intend to use as your data, and how you intend to ingest the data into your database. 
You must select a subject area from which you can get several hundred rows of data. Your dataset should be diverse 
so you can build an interesting real-world database. 

I am going to use the database Education and Career Success.
